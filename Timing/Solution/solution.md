# Solution
You can see that secret.py is Python file that required one parameter which is password to be completely executed. That's mean you can write some script to brute force possible argument. But you don't need to brute force all possible combination of 0-9 and a-z. When you start with 1 character you will notice that `n` give outstanding processing time so that you may write code to monitor execution time. After that, you will notice that `ne` will also provide significant processing time in cases of 2 characters. After and After and After you will finally reach the true password which is `nev3rg`.
