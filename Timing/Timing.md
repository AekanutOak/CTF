# Description
Since we have stolen the secret Python file from enemy, we think that this must contain sensitive informaiton leading us to victory! Our cryptography analyst said that the password of this file contains only the combination of `lowercase english alphabets and digits`. Moreover, the maximum length of password is around `20 characters`. They also notice that `some of input make the processing time significantly vary.` We are counting on you for decrypting this secret!
